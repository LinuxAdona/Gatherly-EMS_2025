# 🎉 GATHERLY EMS - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. **AI-Powered Venue Recommendation System** ⭐⭐⭐

**File**: `src/models/RecommendationEngine.php`

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Multi-criteria decision-making algorithm
- ✅ Weighted scoring system (customizable weights)
- ✅ Collaborative filtering based on historical bookings
- ✅ Match score calculation (0-100%)
- ✅ Individual criterion scores (capacity, price, location, amenities, availability)
- ✅ Alternative venue ranking
- ✅ Recommendation reasoning/explanations

**Algorithm**:

```
Suitability Score = (Capacity Score × 25%) +
                   (Price Score × 30%) +
                   (Location Score × 20%) +
                   (Amenities Score × 15%) +
                   (Availability Score × 10%) +
                   Collaborative Boost (0-5 points)
```

**Example Output**:

- Venue #1: 94.5% Match
  - Capacity: 95%, Price: 92%, Location: 88%, Amenities: 90%, Availability: 100%
  - Reason: "Perfect capacity for 150 guests. Excellent value within budget. Great location and accessibility."

### 2. **Dynamic Pricing & Forecasting System** 💰

**File**: `src/models/DynamicPricingEngine.php`

**Features**:

- ✅ Day-based pricing (weekend vs weekday)
- ✅ Demand-based multipliers
- ✅ Real-time price calculation
- ✅ Occupancy rate tracking

- ✅ Demand tracking system

**Pricing Formula**:

```
Final Price = Base Price × Season Multiplier × Day Type Multiplier × Demand Multiplier

Where:

- Day Type: 1.20 (weekend), 0.95 (weekday)
- Demand: 0.90 to 1.30 (based on inquiries)
```

**Example**:

- Base Price: ₱50,000
- Date: December 25 (Saturday) - Peak Season + Weekend
- High Demand: 10 inquiries this week
- **Final Price**: ₱50,000 × 1.30 × 1.20 × 1.15 = **₱89,700**

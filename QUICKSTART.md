- **Location**: "in Makati" or "near BGC"
- **Amenities**: "with parking and catering"
- **Combined**: "Find a corporate event venue for 150 people, budget 100K, needs sound system and AC"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: "Database connection failed"

**Solution**:

- Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP
- Check `src/services/dbconnect.php` has correct credentials

### Error: "Class not found"

**Solution**:

- Verify all files are in correct folders
- Check file paths in `require_once` statements

### No venues showing in search

**Solution**:

- Make sure `enhanced_schema.sql` was imported
- Check if venues table has data with lat/lng coordinates
- Run this SQL:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM venues WHERE latitude IS NOT NULL;
  ```
  Should return 4

### Dynamic pricing shows only base price

**Solution**:

- Import `enhanced_schema.sql` to add pricing tables
- System needs pricing_history and venue_demand_log tables

### AI Chatbot not responding

**Solution**:

- Check PHP error logs in XAMPP
- Verify `ai_chat_messages` table exists
- Test database connection

## üìä Sample Queries for Testing

Run these in phpMyAdmin to verify data:

```sql
-- Check venues with enhanced data
SELECT venue_id, venue_name, capacity, base_price,
       parking_capacity, has_stage_setup,
       catering_available, sound_system_available,
       latitude, longitude
FROM venues;

-- Check booking history for collaborative filtering
SELECT * FROM venue_bookings_history;

-- Check if recommendations are being saved
SELECT * FROM recommendations ORDER BY recommendation_id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- View demand tracking
SELECT * FROM venue_demand_log;

-- See pricing history
SELECT * FROM pricing_history ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

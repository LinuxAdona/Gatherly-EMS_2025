### Dynamic Pricing & Forecasting

Adapts pricing by:

- **Season (peak/off-peak)**
- **Day (weekends/weekdays)**
- **Demand (number of inquiries)**

### Resource Optimization

Automatically recommends similar venues within the same category or price range if the requested one is unavailable.

### Analytics & Dashboard

Tracks:

- Occupancy rates
- Top venue types
- Event type trends
- Budget statistics
- Price-performance analysis

## Recommendation System

**Formula Example:**

```text
score = (w_capacity * capacity_score)
      + (w_price * price_score)
      + (w_location * location_score)
      + (w_amenities * amenities_score)
      + (w_cf * collaborative_score)
```

**Example Input:**

```
INSERT INTO venues
(name, capacity, price, location_score, amenities_score, collaborative_score, availability_date, parking_score, stage_setup_score, accessibility_score)
VALUES
('Grand Pavilion', 200, 98000, 0.88, 0.95, 0.92, '2025-11-15', 0.90, 0.95, 0.90),
('City Gymnasium', 300, 110000, 0.80, 0.85, 0.89, '2025-11-15', 0.85, 0.90, 0.88),
('Community Hall', 120, 75000, 0.75, 0.80, 0.87, '2025-11-15', 0.80, 0.85, 0.82);
```

**Example Output:**

```
SELECT
    venue_id,
    name,
    price,
    availability_date,

    -- Calculate individual sub-scores
    (150 / capacity) AS capacity_match,  -- Example for 150 attendees
    (120000 / price) AS price_match,     -- Example for 120K budget

    -- Weighted suitability score formula
    (
        (0.25 * (150 / capacity)) +
        (0.20 * (120000 / price)) +
        (0.15 * location_score) +
        (0.15 * amenities_score) +
        (0.10 * collaborative_score) +
        (0.05 * parking_score) +
        (0.05 * stage_setup_score) +
        (0.05 * accessibility_score)
    ) * 100 AS suitability_score

FROM venues
WHERE availability_date = '2025-11-15'
ORDER BY suitability_score DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Result Example:**

| venue_id | name           | price  | suitability_score |
| -------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1        | Grand Pavilion | 98000  | 92.3              |
| 2        | City Gymnasium | 110000 | 86.5              |
| 3        | Community Hall | 75000  | 81.7              |

# Quick Start Guide - Algorithm Comparison Mode

## 🎯 How to Use Algorithm Comparison Mode

### Step 1: Open AI Event Planner

Navigate to: **Organizer Dashboard → AI Event Planner**

### Step 2: Enable Comparison Mode

Toggle the **AI Comparison Mode** switch to ON (blue)

### Step 3: Describe Your Event

Type your event requirements in one message. Include:

- Event type (wedding, corporate, birthday, etc.)
- Number of guests
- Budget (optional)

**Examples:**

```
Wedding for 150 guests with budget of ₱50000
Corporate event for 100 people
Birthday party for 80 guests budget ₱30000
```

### Step 4: Review Results

You'll see **3 color-coded sections**, each showing top 3 venues from different algorithms:

| Algorithm     | Color     | Best For            |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| MCDM          | 🔵 Blue   | Balanced evaluation |
| KNN           | 🟣 Purple | Data-driven matches |
| Decision Tree | 🟢 Green  | Strict filtering    |

### Step 5: Make Your Choice

- **Venues in all 3 algorithms** = Strong consensus picks
- **High scores across algorithms** = Best overall matches
- **Compare differences** to understand algorithm behavior

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Consensus is King**: Venues recommended by all 3 algorithms are your safest bets
2. **Check the Scores**: Higher % = Better match for your requirements
3. **Consider Your Priorities**:
   - Budget-conscious? Trust MCDM
   - Want proven choices? Trust KNN
   - Need strict requirements? Trust Decision Tree
4. **Use Quick Actions**: Click preset buttons for faster queries

## 🔄 Switch Modes Anytime

- **ON** = Instant comparison of all 3 algorithms
- **OFF** = Conversational mode with step-by-step questions

## 🧪 Test Results Example

**Query:** "Wedding for 150 guests with budget of ₱50000"

**Consensus Venues:**

- ✅ Emerald Garden (95.67% avg) - All 3 algorithms
- ✅ Crystal Hall (91.17% avg) - All 3 algorithms

**Why Different Rankings?**

- MCDM: Weighted by budget (35%), capacity (30%), amenities (20%), location (15%)
- KNN: Based on similar successful past bookings
- Decision Tree: Strict pass/fail on capacity and budget constraints
